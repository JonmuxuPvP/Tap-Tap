# Tap-Tap

Tap Tap! is a fun application in the "cookie clicker"-like style where you get random points by clicking a button.

## Usage
This app cannot be executed without the use of a server. I personally used Apache and MySQL with the help of XAMPP to deploy this application locally. If you are interested in running the code, follow the steps:

1. Download the code from this main branch
2. Download XAMPP/LAMPP
3. Export all the files into your respective `htdocs` directory
4. Run Apache and MySQL from XAMPP
5. Import the database found in `sql-exports/test.sql` in localhost/phpmyadmin
6. Navigate to the exported directory through your browser of preference by using `localhost` or `127.0.0.1`
7. Enjoy tapping :3

## What or who is this for?
To kill two birds with one stone, I decided to create a simple, interactive and pretty boring application to learn and practice developing a full-stack web application as well as help my boyfriend <3 with his own web project (which also must be a full-stack web application)

PHP and JavaScript were the languages of choice since it's what fits me better with my current knowledge. Besides, these implementations will probably be used on "Pitch Practice Project", hence two birds with one stone.
